WorkBase:
 
WorkBase will change the flow of creating work orders in your business. Create work orders that are saved immediately, from anywhere.  WorkBase lets users easily track work orders for clients..  Create, edit and delete work orders with the click of a mouse -- or the tap of a finger on your mobile device. 
 
Take one minute to sign up, then you can create work orders immediately that are saved to your account.   Why spend hours scrambling around to gather scraps of paper from your truck, then enter them in an awkward Excel spreadsheet? Click into WorkBase and get started.
 
To get the application up and running simply run npm install and run nodemon on app.js in the server folder. Then go to your localhost at port 8080. When making changes to the source code, logout and then log back in to see the results.
